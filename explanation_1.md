 LRU Cache Uses Pythons's OrderedDict as cache, which keeps track of the order that entries are inserted.Ordered Dictionaries are implement as hash tables.Hash tables should provide average O(1) for search, insertion and deletion. Deleting an entry and reinserting it will move it to the end. If the value of a key is changed, the key position does not change. If m is the size of the data stored in the cache then each set operation will cause it to grow by m up to the maximum size of the cache capacity: O(m*m), n being the cache capacity.
